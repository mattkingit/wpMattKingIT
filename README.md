My Personal Web Page with WordPress

My original WordPress site went down on Host Gator after a PHP update. I am in the process of updating my web page with Blazor I decided to host a WordPress page in Azure for a couple reasons. 
1. More experience with Azure in particular
  1. Azure App Services
  1. Azure Databases
  1. WordPress on Azure
